            <p>
                The development of my leadership skills started with my education.
                I have always had a passion for teaching, and I have been given many oppotunities to teach and mentor others.
                At New Mexico University, I served as a teaching assistant for programming and mathematics courses, helping beginner level students grasp the core concepts of both complex subjects.
                I was also part of community outreach programs, where I led lessons in local high schools with the goal of sparking interest in Computer Science.
                I led a group of students in the creation of grant proposal, and was able to secure funding from Google for local high school programs where I led after-school programming workshops.

                In my career, I have often taken a mentorship role to junior developers and new hires.
                At General Motors, I was responsible for onboarding new team members to the Adobe Experience Manager Forms Ecosystem.
                The new team members, under my guidance, were able to become productive and contributing members of the team within 4 months of starting.
                At StrongMind, I was in a very unique position to mentor and guide the User Experience Team.
                I had the strongest technical skills, and was able to help proliferate those skills to the rest of the team.
                A majority of the team came from a design/art background, and I was able to help them translate their design skills into tangible technical implementations within 1 month of working with them.
                Later on, I was able to do the same for 3 new hires, helping them create pull requests within a week of starting.
