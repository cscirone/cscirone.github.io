                Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) is a Content Management System and Digital Asset Management system that allows organizations to create web experiences through the use of templates and components.
                At General Motors, I became intimately familiar with AEM and AEM Forms through my work on Forms 2.0, Locate New Vehicle, and Vehicle Shopper.
                I was responsible for the creation for AEM Forms components and templates, which were used to create lead generation forms for all of General Motors' brands worldwide.
                I also heavily worked on the brand styles, which were hosted in the AEM DAM.
