            <p>
                Java was the first programming language I learned in university.
                It was fundementally important to the development of my object-oriented knowledge.
                I was also taught about how the JVM works at a base level, which is an important concept to undertand when it is required to run Java.
                In my career at General Motors, I used Java in the form of JSP to create the backend for Forms 2.0 components and for standalone web applications such as Locate New Vehicle and Vehicle Shopper.
