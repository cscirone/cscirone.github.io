            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have often needed to work with multiple teams in order to advance project goals.
                At General Motors, I worked remotely with a team of developers at the General Motors Austin Innovation Center on the Website Branding Platform.
                Working remotely with teams across multiple timezones is a skill that I feel is essential in the modern workplace.
                At StrongMind, I was primarly assigned to the Course Builder project.
                However, I often safaried between projects to help with StrongMind Central, Enrollment, and Prompt Studio requiring me to work with teams both in the office building and remotely in the StrongMind Philippines office (SMLP).
                Working on multiple projects at once, and ensuring that the User Experience is consistent across all of them is something that I am proud to have accomplished at StrongMind.
