                Ruby on Rails is a fascinating framework to me.
                It is the complete MVC package and it very easy to understand with a working knowledge of HTML and JavaScript.
                During my time at StrongMind, I worked within a Ruby on Rails environment.
                I became very familiar with how partials, helpers, controllers, and models work together to create a robust server-side rendering engine.
                While my primary focus was on User Experience, I often found myself reworking partials and helpers in order to properly implement new features and improve existing ones.
                I was particularly involved with the usage and implementation of Turbo.js in applications like Course Builder.
                Turbo allowed me to add single-page application capabilities to Course Builder, allowing for context retention during course navigation, significantly improving the overall user experience.
                Working in a Ruby on Rails environment was also my introduction to Tailwind CSS, which I now consider to be a must-have in my toolkit.
