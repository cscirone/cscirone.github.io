            <p>
                During my time at StrongMind, I was frequently tasked with creating prototypes for new features, applications, and pages.
                I have experience with rapid prototyping tools like Balsamiq, CodePen, HTML, and the classic pen and paper, as well as high fidelity prototyping tools such as Figma.
                Rapid prototyping tools allow me to quickly iterate on ideas, and accelerate the feedback loop between product and design.
                High fidelity prototyping tools such as Figma are very useful for envisioning how atoms and components come together to form a more complete user experience and workflow.
