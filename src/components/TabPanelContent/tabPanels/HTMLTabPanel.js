                Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a powerful tool that is often overlooked in favor of more glamorous technologies like JavaScript and CSS.
                 However, HTML is the foundation of the web, and it is capable of doing so much heavy lifting in frontend development.
                 During my career, I have often made it a point to do as much with HTML before resorting to JavaScript or server-side templating logic.
                 It is often the case that HTML is the most performant solution, and can accomplish most of what you want out of a web application.
                 I have leveraged HTML in my experience creating forms, and complex web components.
