                The Peer Learning Assistant program at NMSU is a program where undergraduate students help tutor their peers in specific classes.
                I was a PLA for an Intro to Java programming class, College Algebra, and Business Calculus.
                During my time in each class, I was responsible for helping the students with their classwork during labs, as well as holding office hours where students could come to me for help with homework and studying.
                I also helped the professor with grading assignments and exams.
                Particularly for the Math classes, I had to be particularly self sufficient, as I played an auxiliary role in the classroom.
                My primary role was to help supplement the professor's often abstract explanations with more concrete examples from my own academic experience.
