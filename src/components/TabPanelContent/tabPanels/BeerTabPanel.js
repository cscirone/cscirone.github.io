                Every college student is very familiar with beer, but do they appreciate it?
                I always thought of beer as an unappealing drink that was only consumed in order to get drunk.
                However, at NMSU, I took a "Brewing Science" class that changed my perspective and appreciation of beer.
                The class was about all things beer, from the history of beer, the culture of beer, and the brewing process.
                The class had two long term assignments.
                The first was a beer journal, where we were tasked with finding 33 different types of beers, and writing a review for each of them.
                We had to consider the flavor, aroma, appearance, packaging, and overall experience of the beer.
                The goal was to develop an expanded palate, and to gain an understanding of all of the different flavors on the flavor wheel.
                The second assignment was to brew our own beer.
                I chose to brew an American Pale Ale, using Cascade hops.
                The process was difficult, especially for a beginner, but I really enjoyed how the beer turned out.
                The cascade hops brought out a characteristic grapefruit flavor.

                This class forever changed how I look at beer, and to this day I still enjoy trying different types from around the world.
                I think that having an appreciation, and respect for beer as a cultural staple of the world is important for developing a healthy relationship with alcohol.
