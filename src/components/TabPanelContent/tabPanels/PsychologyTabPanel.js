                I think that human behavior is something that every professional should study to some extend.
                Understanding human behavioral patterns is impactful in any industry or field of study.
                I took a number of classes that either fully revolved around psychology, or touched on the subject in some way.
                My favorite was an honors class called "The Human Mind: The Computational Theory of Mind".
                This class centered around a theory called the Computational Theory of Mind, which is somewhat of a thought experiment.
                It aims to explain how the human mind works by directly comparing it and its processes to that of a computer.
                Taking the theory to its extremes, it looks at the evolution of social behavior in humans similar to the training of a neural network.

                Beyond the honors class, I also took Social Psychology and Sociology.
                I consider these to be two sides of the same coin, as they both deal with the study of human behavior.
                I find both the analytical and societal aspects of psychology to be highly informative and useful.
                Particularly within the realm of software development and user experience design, understanding human behavior and the reasoning behind it a must.
                It allows for a more concrete reasoning for design decisions, and for a more user-friendly human-computer interaction.
