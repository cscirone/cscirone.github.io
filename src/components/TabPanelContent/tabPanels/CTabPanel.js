            <p>
                The C family of languages are near and dear to my heart.
                I primarly used C and C++ in my education, and I deeply appreciate that they force you to be cognizant of low-level operations and memory management.
                They allow you to have the control that low-level languages provide, while also allowing you access to object-oriented principles that high-level languages are known for.
                I used C# during my education to learn the Unity game engine, which I went on to teach local high school students during my time with the CTiK-12 program at NMSU.
