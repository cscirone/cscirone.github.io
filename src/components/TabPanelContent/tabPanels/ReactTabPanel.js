            <p>
                React is a very powerful framework for building web applications, and while I am fairly new to it, I have already found it to be very useful.
                    This entire website is built with React, using React Router for routing, and Material-UI as a baseline for all UI components.
                    I have found that it is a great utility for building reusable and responsive components, and I am very excited to apply it to my future work.
            </p>
        </TabPanelContent>
    );

export default ReactTabPanel;
