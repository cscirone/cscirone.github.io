                I have experience with using project management tools to catalog, organize, and track the progress of projects, epics, user stories, and bugs.
                At General Motors, we used Microsoft TFS to manage our projects.
                StrongMind uses Jira and Confluence for project management.
                I have experience creating and tracking user stories and bugs, as well as organizing stories into their appropriate epics in a multi-team org-wide context.
