            <p>
                All of my professional experience has been in Agile environments.
                At General Motors, we utilized the SaFE Agile framework.
                At StrongMind, we ascribed to both the Agile and Kanban methodologies, depending on the team's preference.
                I was intimately involved with the Agile process, from weekly sprint planning meetings, to quarterly epic planning sessions.
                For the User Experience Team, I was most often responsible for demoing UX work at weekly demo meetings, and wrote up a large portion of the User Stories revolving around our Design System, Backpack UI.
